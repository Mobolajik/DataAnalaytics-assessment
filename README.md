## ðŸ“Œ Questions and Solutions

### âœ… Question 1: High-Value Customers with Multiple Products

**Scenario:**  
The business wants to identify customers who have both a funded **savings** and **investment** plan for cross-selling opportunities.

**Task:**  
Write a query to find customers with **at least one funded savings plan** AND **one funded investment plan**, sorted by total deposits.

**Tables Used:**
- `users_customuser`
- `savings_savingsaccount`
- `plans_plan`

**Approach:**
- Join `users_customuser`, `savings_savingsaccount`, and `plans_plan` using `owner_id` and `plan_id`.
- Use `WHERE` clause to filter:
  - `plans_plan.is_regular_savings = 1`
  - `plans_plan.is_a_fund = 1`
- Use `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to ensure both conditions are met.
- Sort results by total amount deposited.

### âœ… Question 2: Transaction Frequency Categorization

**Scenario:**  
The finance team wants to analyze how frequently customers transact to segment them (e.g., frequent vs. occasional users).

**Task:**  
Calculate the average number of transactions per customer per month and categorize them as:

- **High Frequency** (â‰¥ 10 transactions/month)
- **Medium Frequency** (3â€“9 transactions/month)
- **Low Frequency** (â‰¤ 2 transactions/month)

**Tables Used:**
- `users_customuser`
- `savings_savingsaccount`


**Approach:**
- Join the necessary tables on `owner_id`.
- Count the number of transactions per user per month using `DATE_FORMAT(transaction_date, '%Y-%m')`.
- Use `CASE` to categorize frequency.
- Use `GROUP BY` and `AVG()` to compute monthly averages.

### âœ… Question 3: Account Inactivity Alert

**Scenario:**  
Operations wants to flag **active accounts** (savings or investments) that had **no deposit transactions in the last 365 days**.

**Task:**  
Find accounts where the **last inflow (deposit) transaction** was over one year ago.

**Tables Used:**  
- `plans_plan`  
- `savings_savingsaccount`
  **Approach**
  -Joins the `savings_savingsaccount` table with the `savings_transaction`.
  -Uses `MAX()` to get the **last transaction date** for each account.
  -Calculates the **number of days** since the last transaction using `DATEDIFF()`.
  -Filters the result using `HAVING` to only show:
   - Accounts with the **last transaction more than 1 year ago**.

  ### âœ… Question 4:  Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation.
  **Scenario:**  
Marketing wants to estimate the **CLV** of each customer using a simplified model.

**Task:**  
For each customer, compute:
- Account tenure (in months since `date_joined`)
- Total number of transactions
- Estimated CLV using the formula: For each customer, assuming the profit_per_transaction is 0.1% of the transaction value
  
**Approach:**  
- Join users and accounts.
- Calculate tenure using `TIMESTAMPDIFF`.
- Use `COUNT` for transactions and multiply by profit rate.
- Apply the CLV formula and order by descending value.
